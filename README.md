# Gosu for Emscripten

This is a **highly experimental** prototype of the [Gosu game engine](https://github.com/gosu/gosu)
running under Emscripten.

This is designed to be linked against my fork of [MRuby](https://github.com/AaronC81/mruby) - see
there for build instructions.

There are definitely things that don't work, but the following features are tested working:

- Drawing rectangles
- Drawing images
- Keyboard input
- Playing samples
